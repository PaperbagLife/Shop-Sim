# Shop-Sim
Shop-Sim is a simulation built in Unity 3d to simulate people walking in a shop and couting the number of times each tile is visited.
While running the scene, press "A" for all players each visiting all tiles, "B" for all players collectively visiting all tiles.
The animation will terminate after all tiles are visited.
You can check the console log for more detailed information on tiles visited.
(You can also click on anywhere on the map to make all players move to that location.)

Unity version 2019.4.16f1

# Shop-Sim
Shop-Sim is a simulation built in Unity 3d to simulate people walking in a shop and couting the number of times each tile is visited.
While running the scene, press "A" for all players each visiting all tiles, "B" for all players collectively visiting all tiles.
The animation will terminate after all tiles are visited.
You can check the console log for more detailed information on tiles visited.
You can also click on anywhere on the map to make the first player move to that location.
You need to drag the main camera on the playermovement script if you want all players to move to cursor location.
You can switch between 4 cameras (you can add more) by pressing the number keys from 0 to 3.
Update:
In scene Get items, press "C" for a mode where the character will wallk around the shop and pick up items on the wall.
The character animation is in progress.
